# GET_NEXT_LINE
## GNL is the second project I've made at 42sp. It allow us to read line by line from a file descriptor.

We are now introduced to read(), open() and close().

Changind completely the way we were doing projects during the basecamp and libft, GNL comes with new functions that we can use.

The essay pdf (that kind of tell us what to do) is very confusing, and most people takes a while to figure out what to do.

After studying about read, open and close, I understood that the file was going to be opened in a separated file,
that included the main and only called our GNL function.

We are not allowed to use our previous library (libft), but we can recode any function that we judge necessary.

Note that we are still following **The Norm**

https://github.com/42School/norminette/tree/master/pdf

that means that we are only allowed to use 5 functions per file, and we can only use 2 files.

The bonus part asks us to read from different file descriptors.
